The goal of these workshops is to gain familiarity with the way that statisticians work: using software (R/RStudio) to manipulate, transform, and visualise data.

## Before we start

Make sure you have both R and RStudio installed. In addition, make sure you have the `tidyverse` package installed.

Both of these are detailed here:
