# Small multiple plots

---

## Small multiple plots

With `dplyr` we can use `group_by()` to do summarising and filtering by subgroups of the data.

We can do the same thing when we produce plots with `ggplot2`.

The idea is that often we want to see trends or patterns between some variables, but often those trends
or patterns may vary by subgroup.

In that case we might want to plot them separately for each subgroup so
we can compare and contrast.

---

## Small multiple plots

One way to do this is to use `dplyr` to filter down to the subgroup that we want to compare and then
produce separate plots.

e.g. suppose we want to compare two sites on the Manawatu river for their E.coli counts over time. The river at Site80 (down by Waitoetoe park, opposite where the Turitea Stream comes out) and the river at Site15 (by the old teacher's college in Hokowhitu):

```{r}
waitoetoe <- hrc |>
  filter(Site == "manawatu at u/s pncc stp",
         Date >= "2008-01-01") |>
  select(Site, Date, Value)

hokowhitu <- hrc |>
  filter(Site == "manawatu at teachers college",
         Date >= "2008-01-01") |>
  select(Site, Date, Value)
```

---

## Comparing sites

.pull-left[
```{r}
waitoetoe |>
  summarise(Median = median(Value),
            Max = max(Value))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
hokowhitu |>
  summarise(Median = median(Value),
            Max = max(Value))
```
]

In terms of the median and maximum these sites are quite similar, which makes sense - they're only about 3km from each other.

We could do a plot of each one and compare.
---

.pull-left[
```{r}
ggplot(data=waitoetoe) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Value)) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels=scales::label_comma()
    )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(data=hokowhitu) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Value)) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels=scales::label_comma()
    )
```
]

---

## Combining plots

The problem here is that each uses different scale. So while the patterns look kinda similar, it's hard to really
know the level as the y-axis scales are a bit different.

We could change the axes to force them to be the same using the `limits` argument to `scale_y_log10()`, but there's
quite a lot of repetition.

And, if we want them on the same scale anyway, why do we need separate y-axis scales? We could just place them side
by side and remove the additional axis space.

---

.pull-left[
```{r}
ggplot(data=waitoetoe) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Value)) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels=scales::label_comma(),
    limits = c(1,20000)
    )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(data=hokowhitu) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Date, y=Value)) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels=scales::label_comma(),
    limits = c(1,20000)
    )
```
]

---

## Combining plots

The better way to do it is to combine the two datasets and let `ggplot2` split out the two groups for us when it creates the plot.

Essentially we work the same way as we would with `dplyr` to summarise: leave the data in a single data.frame.

```{r}
two_sites <- hrc |>
  filter(Site %in% c("manawatu at u/s pncc stp", "manawatu at teachers college"),
         Date >= "2008-01-01")

two_sites |> group_by(Site) |>
  summarise(Median = median(Value), Max = max(Value))
```

---

.left-code[
## Combining plots

```{r facet1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=two_sites) +
  geom_line(
    mapping = aes(x=Date, y=Value,
                  col=Site)
    ) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
  )
```

We could use colour to distinguish the sites
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="facet1", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Combining plots

```{r facet2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=two_sites) +
  geom_line(
    mapping = aes(x=Date, y=Value)
    ) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
  ) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Site)) #<<
```

But having separate plots is better.
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="facet2", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Combining plots

```{r facet3, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=two_sites) +
  geom_line(
    mapping = aes(x=Date, y=Value),
    alpha=0.5
    ) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x=Date, y=Value)
  ) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
  ) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Site))
```

The trend shows that the site at Waitoetoe park used to be
worse than at Hokowhitu, but now is more similar.

They're now both worse?
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="facet3", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

## Combining plots

We can now easily generalise to more plots. e.g. what is happening with the turitea stream which flows into the Manawatu near Waitoetoe Park?

Unfortunately this was measured only since 2013, but nonetheless might be interesting

```{r}
three_sites <- hrc |> filter(
  Site %in% c("manawatu at u/s pncc stp",
              "manawatu at teachers college",
              "turitea at no1 dairy"),
  Date >= "2008-01-01"
)
three_sites |> group_by(Site) |>
  summarise(Median = median(Value), Max = max(Value))
```

A higher median but lower maximum.

---

.left-code[
## Combining plots

```{r facet4, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=three_sites) +
  geom_line(
    mapping = aes(x=Date, y=Value),
    alpha=0.5
    ) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x=Date, y=Value)
  ) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
  ) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Site))
```

We can't tell if the Turitea stream is the
reason for the increased counts pre 2013 as
we don't have the measures then.

The counts post 2013 are higher in the Turitea
stream than in the river (more dilution in the river?)

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="facet4", echo=FALSE}

.left-code[
## Combining plots

```{r facet5, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data=three_sites) +
  geom_line(
    mapping = aes(x=Date, y=Value),
    alpha=0.5
    ) +
  geom_smooth(
    mapping = aes(x=Date, y=Value)
  ) +
  scale_y_log10(
    labels = scales::label_comma()
  ) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Site), ncol=1) #<<
```

Can specify the number of rows or columns.

This allows us to see the correlation in the two Manawatu measures.

But is harder to assess overall levels.

## Combining plots

```{r peng1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) + 
  geom_density(aes(x=body_mass_g),
               fill='light blue') +
  facet_grid( #<<
    rows = vars(sex), #<<
    cols = vars(species) #<<
  ) #<<
```

If we have two variables that we'd like to use to split the data, we can use a grid
of small plots, with rows representing one variable and columns the other.

The `NA` for `sex` though is a bit odd!
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="peng1", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

.left-code[
## Combining plots

penguins |> #<<
  filter(!is.na(sex)) |> #<<
ggplot() +

               fill='light blue') +
  facet_grid(
    rows = vars(sex),
    cols = vars(species)
  )
```

For densities, where the `x` axis is our comparator, we can
easily assess down columns.

i.e. Males are heavier than females for each species, less pronounced in Chinstrap?

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="peng2", echo=FALSE}

.left-code[
## Combining plots

```{r peng3, eval=FALSE}
penguins |>
  filter(!is.na(sex)) |>
ggplot() + 
  geom_density(aes(x=body_mass_g),
               fill='light blue') +
  facet_grid(
    rows = vars(species), #<<
    cols = vars(sex) #<<
  )
```

For densities, where the `x` axis is our comparator, we can
easily assess down columns.

Switching roles of variables means we can easily compare within
males and females separately.

e.g. we see that male Adelie and Chinstraps have similar weight distributions,
while females differ.

penguins |>

               alpha=0.5) + #<<
  facet_wrap(vars(sex), #<<
             ncol=1) #<<
```

In this example the small number of groups allows overlapping
densities to be a little better perhaps.
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="peng4", echo=FALSE}
```
]

## Combining different kinds of plot

Sometimes we want to combine different types of plot. e.g. perhaps we want
to compare the body mass distribution of penguins as well as show the correlation
between bill length and depth.

We can do the separate plots and can combine them using the `patchwork` library

---

.pull-left[
```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_density(
    aes(x=body_mass_g,
        fill=species),
    alpha=0.5)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_point(aes(x=bill_length_mm,
                 y=bill_depth_mm,
                 col=species),
               alpha=0.5)
```
]

---

## Combining plots with `patchwork`

With `patchwork` we first **save** the plots into separate variables, then use `+` or `/` to combine them together.

When you save a `ggplot2` plot, you can 'print' it out by just typing the name. So your code will look like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
g1 = ggplot(data1) + ...
g2 = ggplot(data2) + ...

g1 # To look at the first plot
g2 # To look at the second plot

library(patchwork)
g1 + g2 # To put graphs side by side
g1 / g2 # To put graphs top and bottom
```

---

.left-code[
## Combining plots with `patchwork`

```{r patch1, eval=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
g1 = ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_density(
    aes(x=body_mass_g,
        fill=species),
    alpha=0.5)

g2 = ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x=bill_length_mm,
        y=bill_depth_mm,
        col=species),
    alpha=0.5)

g1 / g2
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="patch1", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```
]

---

## Combining plots with `patchwork`

Use `+` to put things side by side:

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.dim=c(8,3), fig.retina=3}
g1 + g2
```

---

## Combining plots with `patchwork`

The `plot_layout()` function is useful to control things a little.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.dim=c(8,3), fig.retina=3}
g1 + g2 + plot_layout(guides = 'collect')
```

---

The `plot_annotation()` function allows adding titles, subtitles to the total layout.

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.dim=c(8,3), fig.retina=3}
g1 + g2 + plot_layout(guides = 'collect') +
  plot_annotation(title = "Gentoo penguins are chonky and have long, narrow beaks")
```

---

Lots more can be done. See https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/index.html for more!

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
g0 = ggplot(penguins) + geom_density(aes(x=flipper_length_mm, fill=species), alpha=0.5)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.dim=c(8,3.5), fig.retina=3}
(g0 / g1 | g2) + plot_layout(guides = 'collect') +
  plot_annotation(title = "Gentoo penguins are chonky and have long, narrow beaks")
```

# Theming

---

## Theming

The entire layout of a `ggplot2` chart can be customised by the `theme`:

- Background colours
- Size of panel
- All text size, font, style, placement, justification, angle etc
- Space between facets, facet header styles

Basically everything you see on the plot can be customised.

The **easiest** way to customise the plot is to choose a pre-made theme. (Let someone else do the work!)

.left-code[
## Themes

```{r theme1, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_density(
    aes(x=body_mass_g,

The standard theme is `theme_grey`.

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')

# Combining data

---

## Combining data through joins

It is common to receive data in several different spreadsheets.

e.g. if doing a study where samples are taken from animals across farms, you might have a samples spreadsheet, an animals spreadsheet, and a farms spreadsheet.

For final analyses on samples, however, you might want to assess animal or farm-level effects on outcomes at the sample level.

Thus, you'll need to combine the data from these spreadsheets together into a single `data.frame`.

In RStudio, we do this using **joins** in `dplyr`.

---

## Data sets

We'll use a couple of datasets from the Star Wars movies for this.

```{r, message=FALSE}
characters <- read_csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/161122/data/sw_characters.csv")
characters
```

---

## Data sets

We'll use a couple of datasets from the Star Wars movies for this.

```{r, message=FALSE}
films <- read_csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/161122/data/sw_films.csv")
films
```

---

## Joining with `dplyr`

There are two main types of join in dplyr: **mutating joins** and **filtering joins**.

- Mutating joins add new columns from the additional dataset.

- Filtering joins filter out existing columns based on information in the additional dataset.

For both, we need a set of 'primary' or 'key' columns: these are columns that share the same
information so we can merge the datasets together.

e.g. The `films` and `characters` datasets share the `name` column, so that will be our key.

---

## Mutating joins

There are four separate mutating joins:

- `left_join(x,y)` returns all rows in x, and all rows that match these in y. If y doesn't have a match, `NA` will be used.

- `right_join(x,y)` returns all rows in y and all rows that match these in x. If x doesn't have a match in y, `NA` will be used.

- `inner_join(x,y)` returns only rows in x and y that have a match.

- `full_join(x,y)` returns all rows in x and all rows in y. Anything in x or y that don't have a match will be filled with `NA`.

---

.left-code[
## Left join

`left_join(x, y)` returns:
- all rows in x
- all rows that match these in y.
- If y doesn't have a match, `NA` is used.

Rows in y that do not match rows in x are dropped.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/left-join.gif)
]

---

.left-code[
## Left join

`left_join(x, y)` returns:
- all rows in x
- all rows that match these in y.
- If y doesn't have a match, `NA` is used.

If more than one row in y matches a row in x then you duplicate the x information.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/left-join-extra.gif)
]

---

`left_join(x, y)` returns all rows in x, and all rows that match these in y. If y doesn't have a match, `NA` will be used.

```{r}
characters |> left_join(films)
```

---

.left-code[
## Right join

`right_join(x, y)` returns:
 - all rows in y
 - all rows that match these in x.
 - If x doesn't have a match, `NA` is used.

Rows in x that don't have a match in y are dropped.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/right-join.gif)
]

---

`right_join()` returns all rows in the 'right' data set and anything that matches in the left.

```{r}
characters |> right_join(films)
```

---

.left-code[
## Inner join

`inner_join(x, y)` returns:
 - only rows that match in x and y.
 - there is no `NA` from the join.

Rows that don't have a match in either x or y are dropped.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/inner-join.gif)
]

---

`inner_join()` returns only rows in both data sets. No `NA` from the join.

```{r}
characters |> inner_join(films)
```

---

.left-code[
## Full join

`full_join(x, y)` returns:
 - all rows in both data sets.
 - anything that doesn't match gets `NA`.

No rows are dropped.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/full-join.gif)
]

---

`full_join()` returns all rows in both data sets. Anything that doesn't match gets `NA`.

```{r}
characters |> full_join(films)
```

---

## Mutating joins

The `left_join()` is the one I use the most.

Reason is you almost always start with the dataset that has the outcomes you want
in it, and are joining back to explanatory things.

---

## Filtering joins

The two filtering joins only return columns in x. They are:

- `semi_join(x,y)` returns rows in x with a match in y.

- `anti_join(x,y)` returns rows in x that don't have a match in y.

i.e. `semi_join` is for keeping things in, `anti_join` is to filter things out.

---

.left-code[
## Filtering joins

`semi_join(x, y)` returns:
 - rows in x that have a match in y.
 - only information from x.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/semi-join.gif)
]

---

## Filtering joins

`semi_join` will return the characters which are in one or more of our films.

```{r}
characters |> semi_join(films)
```

---

.left-code[
## Filtering joins

`anti_join(x, y)` returns:
 - rows in x that don't match y.
 - only information from x.
]

.right-plot[
![](graphics/dplyr_joins/anti-join.gif)
]

---

## Filtering joins

`anti_join` will return the characters which aren't in any of our films.

```{r}
characters |> anti_join(films)
```

Remember we used `anti_join` to filter out the "stop words" (a, the, of etc) when we did the "Three words" and "Twitter sentiment" analyses.

---

## Summary

- Use `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()` for when you want repeated graphs on subgroups.

- Use the `patchwork` library for combining multiple, different plots.

- Alter the look of plots with the various `theme_*()` functions, and use `theme()` to fine tune.

- Think about which rows you want to keep in the final dataset when joining.

- If you start with the dataset that has all the rows you want in it already, and just want to add some columns from another dataset, use `left_join()`.

- The main case for `anti_join()` and `semi_join()` is a more efficient way to do filtering. It's likely you can do the same job with `filter()` anyway.
