## Summary of a linear model in R

```{r, comment=""}
donkey <- read.csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/227215/data/donkey.csv")
mod <- lm(Bodywt ~ Heartgirth, data=donkey); summary(mod)

## Summary of a linear model in R

```{r, comment="", highlight.output=10:12}
donkey <- read.csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/227215/data/donkey.csv")
mod <- lm(Bodywt ~ Heartgirth, data=donkey); summary(mod)
```


`r fa("atom") ` **First, let's discuss the `Coefficients` table.**

---

## Interpreting the 'Coefficients' table - parameter estimates and inference

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(mod)$coefficients
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
s <- summary(mod)$coefficients
```

The table of coefficients tells us about estimates $a$ and $b$ in the linear model $\mathsf{Mean}[y] = a + bx$.

--

The **`Estimate`** column gives us the point estimates of the parameters.
- The '`(Intercept)`' row relates to the estimate of the intercept $a$ 
- The '`Heartgirth`' row relates to the estimate of the slope $b$
- Plug in the estimates, and our model is: 
$\mathsf{Mean[body weight]} =`r round(s[1,1],1)` + `r round(s[2,1],2)` \times \mathsf{heart girth}$

--

The **`Std. Error`** column gives the standard errors of the parameter estimates.
- Remember, $a$ and $b$ (or $\hat\alpha$ and $\hat\beta$) are *sample estimates* of the true intercept and slope parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 
- If you repeated the study many times with different samples of donkeys, you'd get different parameter estimates every time. So how reliable are the estimates we've made?
- The standard errors tell us how much the point estimates are expected to vary among different samples (as a standard deviation). 

---

## Interpreting the 'Coefficients' table - parameter estimates and inference


```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(mod)$coefficients
```

--

We can use the point estimates ( $a$ and $b$ ) and standard errors ( $\hat\sigma_a$ and $\hat\sigma_b$ ) to build **confidence intervals** for the intercept and slope parameters. Confidence intervals are a common measure of uncertainty for quantities estimated from samples. 

--

Recall the $2\sigma$ rule from Workshop B03: if a random variable $x$ is normally distributed with standard deviation $\sigma$, 95% of values of $x$ will be within the interval $x\pm2\sigma$ = ( $x-2\sigma$ , $x+2\sigma$ ). 

We can apply this rule to calculate 95% confidence intervals for parameters.

--

For estimate $b$ with standard error $\hat\sigma_b$, we construct a 95% confidence interval as $b \pm 2\hat\sigma_b$. Can we assume that $b$ is normally distributed? Usually we can. We'll discuss this in Lecture C3. 

--

For `Heartgirth`, the interval is $`r round(s[2,1],2)` \pm 2 \times `r round(s[2,2],2)`$. Thus, we are 95% confident that the true slope is within the interval  (`r round(s[2,1]-2*s[2,2],2)`, `r round(s[2,1]+2*s[2,2],2)`).

--

Note, if a confidence interval includes zero, we are not convinced that $x$ and $y$ are linearly related at all!

---

## Interpreting the 'Coefficients' table - parameter estimates and inference


```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(mod)$coefficients
```

We can use the point estimates ( $a$ and $b$ ) and standard errors ( $\hat\sigma_a$ and $\hat\sigma_b$ ) to build **confidence intervals** for the intercept and slope parameters. Confidence intervals are a common measure of uncertainty for quantities estimated from samples. 

--

What if we want a 90% confidence interval? We don't have to use 95%. 

--

The probability of a normal variable falling into the $2\sigma$ region is given by `r pnorm(2)-pnorm(-2)`. To obtain a confidence interval with confidence level $g$ ( $0<g<1$ ), one can find the corresponding multiplier as:
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
g <- 0.90
qnorm(1-(1-g)/2)
```

---

## Interpreting the 'Coefficients' table - parameter estimates and inference

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(mod)$coefficients
```

--

The `t value` and `Pr(>|t|)` values relate to testing the **null hypothesis that the true coefficient is 0**.

--

- A good scientists is sceptical of any idea unless there is empirical evidence to support it.

--

- In this study, we are looking for evidence of a linear relationship between the body weight and heart girth of donkeys. 

--

- Does our analysis of this dataset convince you that such a relationship does indeed exist?


---

## Interpreting the 'Coefficients' table - parameter estimates and inference

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(mod)$coefficients
```


The `t value` and `Pr(>|t|)` values relate to testing the **null hypothesis that the true coefficient is 0**.

--

- To test ideas, we actually quantify the evidence *against a null hypothesis*. The null hypothesis is like a sceptical, place-holder position, which we maintain until convinced otherwise. 

--

- Here, our null hypothesis is "*body weight is* ***not*** *related to heart girth*". That is, the true value of the slope $\beta$ is exactly 0. 

--

- Then, we measure the evidence *against* the null hypothesis. 
  - If we have strong evidence against the null, we reject the null and conclude that body weight is related to heart girth in donkeys. 
  - If we do not have evidence against the null, we fail to reject the null and conclude that we have no evidence that body weight is related to heart girth in donkeys.
  - Importantly, **we never "accept the null hypothesis"**. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.


---

## Interpreting the 'Coefficients' table - parameter estimates and inference

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(mod)$coefficients
```

The `t value` and `Pr(>|t|)` values relate to testing the **null hypothesis that the true coefficient is 0**.

--

- When testing the null hypothesis that the coefficient for `Heartgirth` is 0, we are essentially asking "*how plausible would our estimate of `r round(s[2,1],2)` be if the true coefficient is zero?*". In other words, "*could our result just be due to sampling error?*". 

--

- The test statistic '`t value`' is simply `Estimate/Std. Error`. It compares each estimate to its sampling error.

--

- The '`Pr(>|t|)`' is the 'P-value', which determines the result of our hypothesis test. The P-value for `Heartgirth` is tiny. This means that, if there was no relationship between the body weight and heart girth of donkeys, there would be negligible chance of observing an estimate as large or larger than `r round(s[2,1],2)`. 

--

- Thus, our conclusion is that we reject the null hypothesis that $\beta=0$ and conclude that body weight does indeed increase with heart girth.

## Summary of a linear model in R

```{r, comment="", highlight.output=14}
donkey <- read.csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/227215/data/donkey.csv")
mod <- lm(Bodywt ~ Heartgirth, data=donkey); summary(mod)
```


`r fa("atom") ` **Next, we'll look at the bottom part of the summary output. First, what are '`Signif. codes`'?**

---


## Interpreting the 'Coefficients' table - parameter estimates and inference

The linear model summary presents a coded system for p-values:

`Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1`

This represents a scale of statistical significance, as follows:

- If P > 0.1, you get no asterisks and the result is "not significant".
- If 0.05 < P < 0.1, you get no asterisks but a consolation '`.`'. The result is "not significant", but it's marginal. 
- If 0.01 < P < 0.05, you get one asterisk and the result is "significant". 
- If 0.001 < P < 0.01, you get two asterisks and the result is "very significant".
- If P < 0.001, you get three asterisks and the result is "very very significant", I guess.

P-values are always between 0 and 1. 
A small P-value means evidence against the null hypothesis. 
A large P-value means no evidence against the null hypothesis (**not** evidence **for** the null hypothesis). 

---

## Summary of a linear model in R

```{r, comment="", highlight.output = 16:18}
donkey <- read.csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/227215/data/donkey.csv")
mod <- lm(Bodywt ~ Heartgirth, data=donkey); summary(mod)
```


`r fa("atom") ` **Now, we'll look at the bottom three lines of the summary output.**

---

## Interpreting model summary - residuals

`Residual standard error: 10.83 on 383 degrees of freedom`  
`Multiple R-squared:  0.8048,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.8043`  
`F-statistic:  1580 on 1 and 383 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16`

--

The `Residual standard error: 10.83` is simply the standard deviation of residuals, which is the square root of the residual variance. It measures the inaccuracy of our predictions; on average, the points are `10.83` units away from the predicted mean.

--

The residual variance (i.e., the square of the residual standard error) is estimated by

$$\mathsf{Var}_\mathsf{res} = \frac{1}{n-2}\sum_{i=1}^n [y_i - (\hat\alpha + \hat\beta x_i)]^2$$

--

The `383 degrees of freedom` is obtained by subtracting the number of estimated coefficients ( $p=2$ ) from the sample size ( $n=385$ ).


---

## Interpreting model summary - $R^2$

`Residual standard error: 10.83 on 383 degrees of freedom`  
`Multiple R-squared:  0.8048,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.8043`  
`F-statistic:  1580 on 1 and 383 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16`

--

The `Multiple R-squared` value is the proportion of variation in body weight explained by the model (i.e. explained by a linear relationship between body weight and heart girth). 

--

$$
\begin{aligned}
R^2 &= \frac{\mathsf{Variance\ Explained}}{\mathsf{Total\ Variance}} = \frac{\mathsf{Total\ Variance} - \mathsf{Residual\ Variance}}{\mathsf{Total\ Variance}}\\
&= \frac{\sigma_\mathsf{Y}^2 - \sigma_\mathsf{res}^2}{\sigma_\mathsf{Y}^2}= 1-\frac{ \sigma_\mathsf{res}^2}{\sigma_\mathsf{Y}^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

--

A high $R^2$ value suggests that the model explains a lot of the variation of the outcome variable. Once you know the value of the heartgirth, you have a much better idea of what the body weight will be. Our linear model is useful!

--

We will discuss `Adjusted R-squared` in Lecture C6 - multiple linear regression, where we'll fit linear models with more than one predictor.

---

## For our model of donkey body weights, the $R^2$ is 0.80

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.height=5, fig.width=8, message=FALSE}
model_wt_hg <- lm(Bodywt ~ Heartgirth, data=donkey)
ab <- coef(model_wt_hg)
p <- augment(model_wt_hg, interval='prediction')

ggplot(p, aes(x=Heartgirth, y=Bodywt)) +
  ylab("Response variable (Body weight in kg)") +
  xlab("Explanatory variable (Heart girth in cm)") +
  xlim(79,140) +
  ylim(0,229) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", fill = 4) +
  geom_point(alpha=.7) +
  annotate('text', x=95, y=140, 
           label = expression("Unexplained residual variation\nin body weight: ~ 20%"), hjust=1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=.lower, ymax=.upper), alpha=.2) + 
  annotate('curve', x=95, y=160, curvature = -0.2, 
           xend = 110, yend = ab[1] + ab[2]*110 + 20,
           arrow=arrow(angle=20, type='closed', 
                       length=unit(0.15, 'inches'))) + 
  annotate('text', x=121, y=70, 
           label= expression(atop("Variation in "* bold(mean)*" body weight", 
                                  "explained by model: ~ 80%")), 
           hjust=0) +
  annotate('curve', x=120, y=80, curvature = -0.2, 
           xend = 110, yend = ab[1] + ab[2]*110-2,
           arrow=arrow(angle=20, type='closed', 
                       length=unit(0.15, 'inches')))
```

## Interpreting model summary - $F$-test


`Residual standard error: 10.83 on 383 degrees of freedom`  
`Multiple R-squared:  0.8048,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.8043`  
`F-statistic:  1580 on 1 and 383 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16`


--

The `F-statistic` is related to an omnibus test for checking whether **anything** (covariates) in our linear model helps explain body weight.

--

The `p-value` for this test (last line) is same as the P-value for heart girth (`Pr(>|t|)`) in this case, as the only covariate in the model.

--

In models with more than one covariate, i.e. multiple linear regression model, it will be assessing whether any of them help explain the outcome variable.

--

We will discuss more details in Lecture C6.

## Making predictions with a simple linear regression model

---

## Making predictions

We can predict the mean of $y$ for any given value of $x$ by just substituting values into the estimated linear model equation. e.g. for $\mathsf{Heartgirth}=120$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathsf{mean}[\mathsf{Body weight}] &= `r round(s[1,1],1)` + `r round(s[2,1],2)` \times \mathsf{Heart girth}\\
& = `r round(s[1,1],1)` + `r round(s[2,1],2)` \times 120\\
& = `r round(s[1,1] + s[2,1] * 120,1)`
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore, we estimate that donkeys with a heart girth of 120 will have, on average, a body weight of `r round(s[1,1] + s[2,1] * 120,1)`. 


In R, we can use the `predict` function for this:

```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=""}
predict(mod, newdata = data.frame(Heartgirth=120))
```

It is necessary to create a `data.frame` with a column named by `Heartgirth` for the `newdata` argument when we run the `predict` function.

---

## Prediction in R - confidence and prediction intervals

We can use the standard errors of our estimates to quantify the uncertainty for our prediction of the mean body weight of donkeys with a heart girth of 120. This is a **confidence interval for the predicted mean**.

--

```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=""}
new.data <- data.frame(Heartgirth=120)
predict(mod, new.data, interval="confidence")
```

--

We are 95% confident that the true **average** body weight of donkeys with a heart girth of 120 is between  `r round(predict(mod, new.data, interval="confidence")[1,2],1)` and `r round(predict(mod, new.data, interval="confidence")[1,3],1)`. 


---

## Prediction in R - confidence and prediction intervals

We can use the variance of the residuals to predict the **spread of individual values** around the mean. This is a **prediction interval**.

--

```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=""}
predict(mod, new.data, interval="prediction")
```

--

We estimate that 95% of donkeys with a heart girth of 120 will have a body weight between  `r round(predict(mod, new.data, interval="prediction")[1,2],1)` and `r round(predict(mod, new.data, interval="prediction")[1,3],1)`. Note we have not used the word 'mean' or 'average' here, because this is about the spread of values around the mean.

--

It is important that you understand the difference between a confidence interval and a prediction interval.

---

## Prediction in R: two levels of uncertainty

```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=""}
new.data <- data.frame(Heartgirth=c(100,120))
predict(mod, new.data, interval="confidence")
predict(mod, new.data, interval="prediction")
```

---

## Prediction in R: two levels of uncertainty

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=7, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
par(mar=rep(0,4), cex=1.5)
set.seed(2015)
x <- rnorm(100, 3, 1)
y <- 0.5 + 0.5*x + rnorm(100, 0, 0.3)
line <- lm(y ~ x) 
plot(y ~ x, col=alpha(1, .8), xlim=c(min(x)-0.25, max(x)+0.25), ylim=c(min(x)-0.25, max(y)+0.25),
     pch=19, xlab="", ylab="", xaxt="n", yaxt="n", xaxs="i", yaxs="i")

polygon(c(xv,rev(xv)),c(yv_p[,2], rev(yv_p[,3])), col=alpha(1, .3), border=NA)
polygon(c(xv,rev(xv)),c(yv_c[,2], rev(yv_c[,3])), col=alpha(1, .3), border=NA)
abline(coef(line), lwd=3, col = 4)
legend("bottomright", border = NA, 
       lty=c(1,1,1),
       # fill=c(NA, alpha(1, .6), alpha(1, .3)), 
       col=c(4, alpha(1, .6), alpha(1, .3)), lwd=c(3,20,20), 
       legend=c("Regression line", "Confidence interval for the mean", "Prediction interval for the data"), bty="n")
```

---

## Prediction in R: wider intervals, more confidence

By default, `predict` returns a 95% interval. You can adjust the argument `level` between 0 and 1 to get narrower or wider intervals. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=""}
new.data <- data.frame(Heartgirth=c(100,120))
predict(mod, new.data, interval="confidence", level = 0.99)
predict(mod, new.data, interval="prediction", level = 0.99)
```



---

## Confidence and prediction intervals

--

We can predict the mean of $y$ given any reasonable values of $x$. 

--

For a refined grid of $x$, we can lineate the lower limits and upper limits of corresponding confidence/prediction intervals.

--

This leads to a pointwise confidence/prediction band for our linear model. 

--

As we can see from the previous plot, among 100 pairs of observations, there are a few points falling outside the 95% prediction band.

## Comparing Two Models with $R^2$ and **MSE** 

---

## Another possible model?

--

A scientist dismissed the linear model studied by us and then conjectured that the relationship between the body weight and the heart girth is best modelled by a power-law relationship as

$$\mathsf{Body weight} = c\times [\mathsf{Heart girth}]^k$$

with $c$ and $k$ being some unknown parameters.

--

How can we handle this non-linear model?

--

We can still fit this model under the framework of simple linear regression!

--

We just apply a log transformation to both sides of the above power-law relationship as

$$\log(\mathsf{Body weight}) = \log(c) + k\times \log(\mathsf{Heart girth})$$


---

## Fit the transformed model

--

Set the response $y=\log(\mathsf{Body weight})$ and the predictor $x=\log(\mathsf{Heart girth})$.

--

The parameters can be further transformed as $\alpha=\log(c)$ and $\beta=k$.

--

We can now fit a linear model to the transformed data 

--

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mod2 <- lm(log(Bodywt) ~ log(Heartgirth), data=donkey)

## Comparing two models via the goodness of fit

--

The '`Multiple R-squared`' or ' $R^2$ ' is called '**the coefficient of determination**'. It measures the proportion of variation in $y$ that is  explained by a model.

--

For the linear model in the raw scale, $R^2=0.80$.

--

For the linear model in the log scale, i.e. the power law model, $R^2=0.82$.

--

The power law model explains more of the variation in the data. By this measure, it is better than the original linear model fit to the raw $x$ and $y$.

---

## Comparing two models via prediction (MSE)

--

$R^2$ is a convenient index for comparing two models.

--

A high $R^2$ suggests a good fit to the observed data.

--

In other words, a model with a high $R^2$ explains more variation in the response variable $y$, and leaves less of the variation in $y$ as unexplained random 'noise'.

--

In statistics, when we are building a linear model, our focus may be on the things we have not observed, i.e. **prediction** or **forecasting**.

--

A high $R^2$ does not necessarily yield a good prediction model.

--

Correspondingly, a low $R^2$ does not necessarily lead to a bad prediction model! It is better to have a more realistic model with more noise than an unrealistic model that makes overconfident predictions.

## *All models are wrong, but some are useful*
### — George E.P. Box

---

## *All models are wrong, but some are useful* — George E.P. Box

--

While the linear model on untransformed data isn't as good, it might still be OK for your purposes. 

--

For example, if you were only using the model for 'typical' donkeys in the middle of the range of $x$ and $y$. Maybe, on your own farm, most of your donkeys are pretty fit.

--

The key idea is that the model we come up with is always going to be 'wrong' in some way, but it might still be good enough.

--

Even the linear model on log-transformed data, i.e. the power law model, can't explain all the variability in the donkey's body weight!
   
--

We will see better models in the next few weeks.

---

## Comparing two models via prediction (MSE)

--

In the scientific research, after building some candidate models, the researchers have to conduct experiments to collect new data to validate those models. 

--

Given an observed sample of data $(x_{1},y_{1}),\ldots,(x_{n},y_{n})$, let the fitted linear model be $y=\hat\alpha+\hat\beta x$. 

--

A researcher now collect a new sample of data as $(x_{n+1},y_{n+1}),\ldots,(x_{n+m},y_{n+m})$. 

--

She or he can compute the predictions of the fitted model at the values $x_{n+1},\ldots,x_{n+m}$ as $\hat{y}_{n+1}=\hat\alpha+\hat\beta x_{n+1},\ldots,\hat{y}_{n+m}=\hat\alpha+\hat\beta x_{n+m}$.

--

The prediction performance can be evaluated by comparing the true observed responses $y_{n+1},\ldots,y_{n+m}$ against the predicted responses $\hat{y}_{n+1},\ldots,\hat{y}_{n+m}$.

---

## Comparing two models via prediction (MSE)

--

Similar to the residual variance, we can define the **mean square error** (**MSE**) as

$$\mathsf{MSE}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(y_{n+i}-\hat{y}_{n+i})^2$$

--

MSE serves a critical index to measure the prediction performance of candidate models.

--

It reduces to the residual variance if we supply the original observation $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ to it. 

--

Often need a new dataset to judge the predictive accuracy of a model! 

---

## Prediction for the power law model

Notice that we fit a linear model to the logged body weight and logged heart girth and the prediction from `predict` function is in the log scale. So we need to exponentiate it to get it back to the raw scale. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=""}
new.data <- data.frame(Heartgirth=c(100,120))
pred <- predict(mod2, new.data, interval="prediction")
pred
exp(pred)
```

## MSE for the power law model

The residual variance for the linear model with transformation, i.e., power law model is also calculated in the log scale. We can then calculate the MSE of the power law model in the raw scale and compare it with the MSE (residual variance) of the linear model in the raw scale. 

```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=""}
n <- length(donkey$Bodywt)

pred.linear <- predict(mod)
MSE.linear <- sum((donkey$Bodywt - pred.linear)^2)/n
MSE.linear

pred.powerlaw <- exp(predict(mod2))
MSE.powerlaw <- sum((donkey$Bodywt - pred.powerlaw)^2)/n
MSE.powerlaw
```

## MSE for the power law model

--

- `predict()` returns the fitted values for the original data if `new.data` is not supplied.

--

- `sum()` returns the summation of a vector

--

- The basic arithmetic and function operations, like `exp()`, `-`, `^2` and `/n`, is applied to sequences of predictions `pred.linear`, `pred.powerlaw` and observations `donkey$Bodywt` term by term.  

--

- We can see that the power law model outperforms the linear model in terms of MSE. 

--

- We will confirm this result again in Lecture C4 - Residual Diagnostics!

--

- However, MSE here still serves as an index on the goodness of fit, not really an indicator on the prediction performance.  

--

- We will see a few more examples on prediction in the coming weeks.

## A tidy way to compute the MSE

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(broom)
augment(mod) |> summarise(MSE.linear = mean((Bodywt - .fitted)^2))
augment(mod2) |> summarise(MSE.powerlaw = mean((exp(`log(Bodywt)`) - exp(.fitted))^2))
```

## A tidy way to compute the MSE

The R function `augment()` from the package `broom` extracts the predictors, responses, fitted values, residuals and some other information from `mod` and organizes them into a tidy fashion. Notice the column name of this tibble.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
augment(mod2)
```
