- I'm a statistician with two pets and one kid.

- Interested in statistical modelling of disease.

- Two main areas: [spatio-temporal modelling](https://jmarshallnz.github.io/talks/nzsa2016), and [source attribution](https://jmarshallnz.github.io/talks/OHA2019).

---

## Topic A: The way we work

- Learning R/RStudio.

- Charting and visualisation with `ggplot2`.

- Reproducible analysis with `rmarkdown`.

- Data wrangling with `dplyr`.

- The importance of tidy data.

---

## Software

We use R via RStudio. https://www.r-project.org

R was developed in Auckland, by [Ross Ihaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka) and [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician%29), but now there are a cast of thousands.

It is programming language that is built with statistical analyses in mind.

You will **learn to write code** to clean data, produce charts, and build models.

We interact with R via the RStudio front-end: https://rstudio.com

Both are free, and you should install them on your computer. Instructions are here:

https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/help/usingrin161.122.html

---

## Getting help

- Use the stream forums to ask for help.

- Use the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Mzk7fUk) to ask for help.

- We encourage you to help your classmates on stream (or in workshops) as well.

- Try and help us (and your classmates) help you: e.g. if you have an R issue, copy your code and the error so we can spot the problem.

- Google is super useful! Include "R" or "RStudio" or maybe the name of the package "ggplot" or "dplyr" in your query.

- Check the date of the google responses: older results might well be out of date.

# Demo: What do you think statistics is?

https://forms.gle/8F5SDpCrmsuWRCfQ6

## What do I think statistics is?

Three words I might use to describe what we're going to do in 161.122:

- Charts

- Data

- Models

---

## What do I think statistics is?

Three words I might use to describe what we're going to do in 161.122:

- **Charts** Telling stories with data. Variation matters.

- **Data** Understanding data limitations. Importance of randomness.

- **Models** Quantifying uncertainty, inferring relationships, making decisions.

**It's about quantifying evidence in the face of uncertainty.**

## Ruled OK by the advertising standard's authority

- Comparing a long term average to a single day

- Bars are obviously not in proportion to values.

- Tax proportion in both plots is incorrect.
]

.right-plot[
<img src="graphics/national_ruled_ok.jpeg" height="70%" />
]
---

## General rules

- Don't mislead.

- Compare like with like.

- Axes should start at zero where bar height represents values.

- Ensure you show where the data are from and how you generated the chart.

- Show variation or uncertainty where you can.

# `ggplot2`

---

## What is `ggplot2`

- `ggplot2` is a package for R by Hadley Wickham

- Based on the **grammar of graphics**

- Uses a consistent 'language' to produce different plots

- Very flexible, particularly for complex plots

- Everything is editable

- **BUT: Quite a lot to type!**

---

.left-code[
## Quite a lot to type
```{r quakes, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = quakes) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = long,
      y = lat
    )
  )
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r ref.label="quakes", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

## Helpful resources

- The `ggplot2` cheatsheet in RStudio: https://rstudio.org/links/data_visualization_cheat_sheet

- The `ggplot2` book: https://ggplot2-book.org/

- The `ggplot2` page on tidyverse.org: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/

- Search stackoverflow.com: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2?sort=faq

---

## What is the grammar of graphics?

Basic idea: Specify plot building blocks and combine them to produce a plot.

- Data. Always use a `data.frame`

- Aesthetics. Mapping of your data to a plot aesthetic (position/colour/fill/shape)

- Geometries. Points/Lines/Boxplots/Histograms etc

- Statistical transformations

- Scales and coordinate systems

- Position adjustments

- **Faceting** (small multiple plots)

## Example: Penguins!

Data today were collected by [Dr Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antartica Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://pal.lternet.edu/).

This is available for R in the `palmerpenguins` package.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```

---

.left-code[
```{r peng1, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      y = body_mass_g
      )
    )
```
]

.right-plot[
```{r ref.label="peng1", echo=FALSE}
```
]
---

## Recipe

To create a chart we need to:

- Tell R we want a plot with `ggplot()`.

- Tell `ggplot` what data we are plotting with `data=penguins`.

- Choose what type of chart we want by adding a layer (geometry), e.g. `geom_point`.

- Tell the geometry how to map from visual content/features to data with `mapping = aes()`.

All our charts will follow the same basic recipe. We might just add a few more ingredients!

---

.left-code[
## Recipe
```{r peng2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) + #<<
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      y = body_mass_g
      )
    )
```
Tell `ggplot` what data we want to plot.
]

.right-plot[
```{r ref.label="peng2", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Recipe
```{r peng3, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point( #<<
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      y = body_mass_g
      )
    ) #<<
```
Choose the type of chart we want.
]

.right-plot[
```{r ref.label="peng3", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Recipe
```{r peng4, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes( #<<
      x = flipper_length_mm, #<<
      y = body_mass_g #<<
      ) #<<
    )
```

Map plot features to data features.
]

.right-plot[
```{r ref.label="peng4", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

.left-code[
## Mapping colour to data
```{r peng7, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      x = flipper_length_mm,
      y = body_mass_g,
      colour = species #<<
      )
    )
```

- Automatically adds a guide or legend.

- `x` and `y` have guides too (the axes).
]

.right-plot[
```{r, ref.label="peng7", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

## Remember the Recipe!

- Tell R we want a plot with `ggplot()`.

- Tell `ggplot` what data we are plotting with `data=penguins`.

- Choose what type of chart we want by adding a layer (geometry), e.g. `geom_point()`.

- Tell the geometry how to map from visual content/features to data with `mapping = aes()`.
