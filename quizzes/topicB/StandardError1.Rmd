Question
========

Let $x_1,x_2, \ldots ,x_{`r SampleSize`}$ be a random sample from a population with mean of `r SampleMean` and a
standard deviation of `r SampleSD`. Then the standard deviation of $\bar{x}$ is closest to...

```{r questionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========

The standard deviation of $\bar{x}$, also known as the standard error, is the standard deviation `r SampleSD` divided by the square root of the sample size, so we could use <code>`r SampleSD`/sqrt(`r SampleSize`)</code>.

```{r solutionlist, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(mchoice2text(solutions, markup="markdown"), explanations, markup = "markdown")
```
